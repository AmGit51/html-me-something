        </div>
        <p>Hello, my name is Ashley. I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. I am not a world traveler yet, but I'm excited to share some of my travel experience throughout the USA with you. 
          My travel experience began when I was in high school and continued from there. I have traveled to five great cities with family and friends. These were great experiences for me because I enjoy 
          visiting new places and attending various events. I hope that my stories will provide you with great information and encourage you to travel to these cities as well. I want to thank you in advance
          for visiting my website and I wish you all the best!
        </p>

            <h3>WINTER PARK, CO</h3>
            <p>In high school, I was a jazz pianist in the school jazz band. I became a first-time traveler when my high school jazz band went to Winter Park, Colorado for a jazz band competition. 
            We traveled there on a bus and hung out at the Winter Park resort for a few days. This beautiful resort is right next to the mountains where I received my first skiing lessons. 
            I was afraid of skiing at first because of how tall the mountains were, but I had a ski instructor and a few friends from the band to help me get used to it. I also enjoyed riding on ski lifts 
            and visiting a big bakery store that was located on top of the mountain. After my skiing lessons, I did some shopping. I bought some T-shirts, hats, and stuffed animals as souvenirs and gifts at 
            various Winter Park gift shops. Overall, I had a great time participating in the school jazz band competition and learning how to ski.</p>

          <h3>KANSAS CITY, MO</h3>
          <p>I went to Kansas City during my last year of community college to attend a Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society Conference. As a member of Pi Kappa chapter, I was given the opportunity to 
          attend Phi Theta Kappa seminars and luncheons with my group at a Kansas City hotel. I also represented my group by selling shirts at the Pi Kappa booth for the event. After working at
          the booth, my group and I decided to attend the Kansas City Ballet event at the Lyric Theatre. The Kansas City Ballet Company did an excellent performance. The dancers did classical and
          contemporary dance performances. I admired all the beautiful music, costumes, and stage props that they used for their show. I did not get to see or do much more than that in Kansas City,
          but I had a great time and I hope to visit this city again to try out its most famous BBQ restaurants next time.</p>

          <h3>SEATTLE, WA</h3>
          <p>During my last year of community college, I also went to Seattle for another Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society Conference with the Pi Kappa Chapter group. This trip was my first time in an airplane. 
          When we arrive at Seattle, we attended various seminars and luncheons at a Seattle hotel. We also stayed at a hotel that had an amazing view of the Space Needle. During our breaks from the
          conference, we visited the Public Market Center where there was a great fish market. The fishermen at the market were very funny and kind. They pulled some pranks with us by surprising us with a big fish 
          that they like to pop out of the fish basket at tourists. They also sold us some fresh fish and took time to take pictures with us. At the Public Market Center, we visited various gift shops and restaurants.
          The Public Market Center also had great street musicians and a great view of the Puget Sound. The Puget Sound is an inlet of the Pacific Ocean. After visiting the Public Market Center, we visited the 
          Underground Museum. The Underground Museum was a very dark and mysterious place that showed us the view of the city from underground. It displayed old concrete walls, furniture, toilets, and pictures
          that represented its dark history. I did not like how the place looked or what it represented, but I found its history to be very interesting. Overall, I enjoyed the whole experience and wish to travel
          back to Seattle to see the Space Needle and other landmarks someday.</p>

          <h3>CHICAGO, IL</h3>
          <p>I have visited Chicago twice in my lifetime so far. I first visited this city when I was in a youth church choir and came back for my second visit when I was in a college music education program.
            During my first visit, I did some charity work with my church choir by helping low-income families get their groceries. The church choir also sang for the homeless at a Chicago church.
            After we did our charity work, we went to the Navy Pier where there was some great restaurants and gift shops to see. The Navy Pier also had some nice Carnival rides and a great view of 
            Lake Michigan. As for my second trip to Chicago, it was my first train ride outside of St. Louis. I did this trip with my fellow music ed classmates who wanted to attend a Music Education Conference
            at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago. My second trip gave me the opportunity to see Chicago close to Christmas time. This hotel was decorated beautifully with various Christmas trees. During our breaks
            from the conference, we dined out at various restaurants nearby. The pizza restaurant was one of my favorites because I love pizza and the variety of pizza that it had to offer.
            I forgot the name of it, but I would like to go back there to eat. Other than that, I enjoyed eating at all the restaurants that we visited. I did not see or do much more
            than that in Chicago, but I hope to see more of it when I can.</p>

          <h3>RALEIGH, NC</h3>
          <p>I went to Raleigh with my sister and cousin a year ago. We went to Raleigh to visit another cousin who moved there. After we arrived there, we went to the hotel and stayed in Raleigh for four days.
            Our four-day vacation gave us the opportunity to reconnect with one another and visit various places. We went to the mall, the movie theater, and various restaurants. The most memorable part of our vacation
            was visiting the Carolina Beach. It was long four-hour trip from our hotel to the beach and back, but it was worth it. The Carolina Beach was huge and very beautiful. We visited the Ocean Grill and
            Tiki bar to take pictures. We also noticed how popular the beach was. It had a lot of people out there swimming in the Atlantic Ocean or sitting in their beach chairs while they admired the view.
            We did not stay long at the beach, but it was a great experience because it was my first trip to a beach. I hope to go back to Raleigh again to see more of it. I also hope to visit South Carolina's most 
            famous beach, Myrtle Beach, someday.</p>
